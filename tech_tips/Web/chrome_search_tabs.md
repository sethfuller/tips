# Tab Search

Chrome has a new feature to let you search tab titles and URLs over
multiple Chrome windows. Go to chrome://flags/#enable-tab-search set
Default to Enabled and click Relaunch at the bottom of the screen. You
then get a dropdown arrow at the right of the title bar. Click it and
you can search for text in any tab title or URL.
