;; PLANNING Work on the Emacs workflow system

;; NEXT Automatically clock in to :flow: t children using org-goto-first-child
;; When looking at the style of work I do, my work falls in to four broad categories: interrupts, projects, idle actions, and schedulings. The core of my task management is built around Org mode1, built in to Emacs, with hooks integrating it in to my desktop environments and other parts of my workflow.

;; Most of my org-mode workflow is built on top of Bernt Hansen's wonderful org-mode literate configuration

(provide 'cce-org)

;; Loading Org-mode

;; Org-mode is a huge piece of kit, and is incredibly powerful. We have a lot of directions that we can take its use, and curating that is a very important aspect to making sure that we can stay productive with it. I load org-plus-contrib to get the version of org-mode from Org ELPA, which is more up to date and shiny.

;; We should use Org-mode for any file that is .org or .org_archive.

(install-pkgs '(org-plus-contrib))
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.\\(org\\|org_archive\\)$" . org-mode))

;; Org is wonderfully modular, allowing you to only pull in what you need, and to ignore the rest of it. We curate a small list of modules to include, matching the pieces of kit that Org is going to interact with.

;; org-id 3: Gives each entry a GUID which can be referenced easily with org-id-get, org-id-find, org-id-goto etc functions.
;; org-habit 4: Habits are a wonderful new part of Org mode which allows you to create repeating events that have a certain elasticity to them, as well as view the history of them easily in agendas.
;; org-protocol 6: Intercepts certain types of emacsclient calls to seamlessly org-capture. I use this to feed browser tabs in to Org-mode.
;; org-w3m 7: Allows you to yank HTML from w3m and paste it in to org, in org format.
;; org-bbdb 8: Another link integration module, linking to BBDB entries in Org-mode.

(setq org-modules '(org-id
                    org-habit
                    org-protocol
                    org-eww
                    org-bbdb
                    org-choose
                    org-panel
                    org-tempo
                    org-depend))

;; After setting org-modules we load in Org-mode itself.

;; Global Key Bindings

;; Let's set up a bunch of keybindings; we want the most common tasks that we run to be easily accessible, and on a good easy to grab keybinding. A lot of these are inspired by Bernt's keybindings.

;; Wherever I am, I can hit C-c l to store a link to that thing (assuming its a mode that supports Org-mode links), or I can hit C-c c to enter Org capture, which I'll get in to in a bit

;; bh Helper Functions

;; Data Types

;; Tasks

;; The basic unit of "thing to do".

;; Tasks can be grouped in to TAGged categories by the type of task they are, and can also be given locational context with tags prefixed with @, for example @APARTMENT for tasks I need to be at home to do.

;; States
;; WAITING tasks are things that are waiting on the completion of other tasks
;; NEXT tasks are things that I can work on right now; they are not blocked by anything and can be picked up
;; INPROGRESS tasks that are currently being worked on; this is a shortcut for "NEXT and have had clocks applied", as a way to easily eyeball them.
;; DONE tasks that are complete and ready for archiving
;; ICEBOX tasks that are on ice until future work deems it necessary. These, in general, could also be archived in a non-DONE state but this makes it easier to get the full picture of a project.
;; tasks-workflow.png

;; Interrupts
;; Interrupts are external asks that require an immediate or near-immediate context switch. A server catching on fire, a code review request. These tasks should be catelogged easily and it should be easy to reference where my time, as a whole, is being spent.

;; Capturing and working with interupts should be the easiest part of my workflow; Org-mode's capture templates 9 come a long way to make this happen, they just need the final 5% to make them truly first-class in my workflow by defining capture templates to ease recording my most common interrupts.
;; States
;; The states array for Interrupts are the same as for Tasks.

;; Projects
;; Projects are long-term groupings of tasks towards a certain goal; bring up a datacenter, build and fly a new RC plane from scratch, travel the world, raise a family. Projects don't have to specify a number of tasks, or their size, or anything along those lines. A grouping of tasks to reach a certain goal is a project.I will categorize and contextualize hundreds of tasks across tens of projects, because that is naturally how I best work; my long term goals are many and varied, and my system should catelog those as well as it catelogs the code reviews that I need to complete before the end of the day.

;; States
;; PLANNING Projects that I have sketched out but not begun; I will often go and greenfield something and then forget about it; this signals that state where I have not actually begun work on something, and may well have not even finished brainstorming it.
;; NEXT Projects that have been planned but are not yet in progress.
;; INPROGRESS Projects that have been worked on.
;; ICEBOX Projects that I am putting on ice for the time being.

;; You'll notice that there is no DONE state for a project. I don't actually think that's a useful thing for Projects for a few reasons. First, I don't think a project is ever truly done, simply that it's been on ice or abandoned. Done is needlessly final. Second, when a project isn't being worked on any more, it shares no context with the projects around it, unlink Task states. Projects live on their own, and can die on their own.

;; Schedulings
;; Schedulings are, in the broadest sense, things that are pre-planned, but one off. Meetings, events, habits, all of these should be exposed in my Agendas to properly contextualize the amount of work I'll be able to complete outside of them. These can exist in many places â€“ some may be in my Work calendar stored on Google's servers, some may be from RSS feeds, some may come from static iCal files such as Meetup or Eventbrite provide.

;; States
;; States all converge to DONE here, and there is not a true workflow, really. These tasks exist to track time, not necessarily project cadence, and thus don't have a cadence of their own really.

;; MEETING In person meetings, whether they are one-offs or recurring.
;; PHONE Phone calls, yeah, you know.
;; DONE Objects that we no longer need to track.
;; CANCELED Shit that didn't happen.
;; The problem that I have yet to tackle with Scheduling objects comes to recurring situations. A weekly phone call, a daily standup; there will be notes and state that should be exposed easily with these events. Org mode has the ability to tack notes on to a clocking period, but it doesn't allow for a full org-outline, simple plain text only, which makes this a subpar situation IMO. I think that the proper solution may be to datestamp recurring Scheduling entries and write some Elisp which finds recurring MEETING and PHONE entries and pushes out datestamped entries.

;; Idle States and Actions
;; Idle actions provide things for the space between. These actions are things like zeroing your inbox, reading Twitter, expanding Hacker News or Reddit, or consuming expanded articles. The idle actions list should be invisible to me when I am working, and only when I explicitely ask to be distracted should it appear.

;; States
;; IDLE Recurring Idle States
;; NEXT Idle actions waiting to be done
;; DONE Completed idle actions
;; idle-workflow.png

;; So this is interesting; they actually appear to be two seperate classes of actions, that I've bunched together for the sake of discussion. Tasks that recur in idle state, such as zeroing, will be tagged IDLE. When completed they fall back to IDLE state to be done again. Things like captured expansions come in as NEXT, so that they can be closed out as DONE once you've read them.

;; Tagging
;; A core part of my workflow is that of Tagging capture entries. It lets me easily and semantically filter the types of tasks that I have, generate well defined block agendas, and generally makes things much easier to do.

;; I have two main types of tags, I have geospatial tags and I have context tags.

;; Geospatial tags are tags that relate to a place that a task can be done. @OFFICE for example are tasks that can only be completed while physically being in the office. These differ from WORK tasks, because I can do work anywhere that I have a laptop and internet connection.

;; Context tags are the type of work that these tasks encompass; are they SHOPPING items that I need to get, are they related to my HEALTH like my Exercise habits?

;; Time Tracking

;; Time Tracking is a useful habit for many reasons. It provides a wealth of data that you can use to improve your workflow and your general efficiency; it can show you where you are struggling and give you a frame of reference that no other tool can accurately do. Time Tracking can be about billing, if you're a contractor or if you're paid hourly. I am not, I'm a salary worker, but it is still, in my opinion, important to make sure that you're reaching a certain level of efficiency in your work.

;; Org mode provides time tracking as a first class citizen, you can use it to do the logging itself, as well as analyze and visualize the data.

;; Core ideas:

;; Time track everything; not for the benefit of your employer but as a way to gauge the efficiency and efficacy of your work. By quantifying these things, we provide a data source that can be later analyized to see if I am too interupted, if I am struggling on a project, and what class of tasks I most often find myself blocked on or blocked by. My environment should yell at me if I am not tracking my time when I am working on a work or personal project.
;; Time tracking should be painless, and integrated in to my workflow; clocking in and out at the end of the day should be an easy act, a single keystroke that I can hit when I open up my laptop at the office and again at the end of the day. Jumping from task to task should be similarly painless, a single keystroke will allow me to change context to a new or existing task.
;; My workflow is based on Bernt's workflow; I have a default task that I clock in to when I'm doing anything productive, that is my "Organization" task. That is a global variable that any of my helper functions can grab and do things with.
